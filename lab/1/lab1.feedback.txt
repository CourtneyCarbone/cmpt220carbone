Courtney,

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because a program cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -1pt


Style Check

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

- Most class names do not start with capital letter. They must.

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.


About your essay:

- Good writing and analysis.



Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
